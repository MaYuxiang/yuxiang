I am currently an associate professor in the School of Computer and Information Engineering at Henan University (HENU).

I love traveling, and I have traveled to 28 provinces (more than 150 tourist cities) in China. 

I love running and swimming. I have participated in the marathon twice and completed the full marathon (42.195 kilometres) in four hours and fifteen minutes.

In addition, I also love photography, reading, collecting stamps and collecting park tickets.
